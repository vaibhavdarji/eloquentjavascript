<!--
    Write a program that draws the following shapes on a canvas:

A trapezoid (a rectangle that is wider on one side)

A red diamond (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians)

A zigzagging line

A spiral made up of 100 straight line segments

A yellow star
When drawing the last two, you may want to refer to the explanation of Math.cos and Math.sin in Chapter 14, which describes how to get coordinates on a circle using these functions.

I recommend creating a function for each shape. Pass the position, and optionally other properties such as the size or the number of points, as parameters. The alternative, which is to hard-code numbers all over your code, tends to make the code needlessly hard to read and modify.
